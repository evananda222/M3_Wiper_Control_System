# INTRODUCTION
- A windshield wiper or wiper blade is a device which is used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, water, from a vehicle's front window. 
- Every heavy  motor vehicles including cars, trucks , train locomotives and some aircraft—are installed  with such wipers .
- After reading several research papers , I understood that safety requirements under unfavourable weather condition is necessary even at low speed also for motor vehicles and therefore I started making wiper control system using arm based microcontrollers. 
- It consist of rubber blades attached at its metal arms with pivot magnets at its other ends.
- Finally this project application helps users in day to day life and prevents accidents and allows safe and healthy journey.

## RESEARCH
This application was analyzed from different sources (such as YouTube, Google, and research papers), and then adapted into a successful functioning model application of a wiper control system employing arm-based microcontrollers. 

## END GOAL
- Clear viewing in inclement weather. 
- Avoid accidents and promote safety with the most recent mechanism.

### Who
-  Everyone who wishes to drive safely and with a clear picture of the road.
### What
-   Wiper Control System for Automotives.
### Why
-   Curious about carrier in embedded system . 
### When 
-   When you recognise the significance of safety management and begin to hold yourself accountable for your health when driving in adverse weather conditions.
### Where
-   This can be  used by the user in day to day life where they can track their safety and  generate better results in life during travelling via motor vehicles  .
### How
-   LED shows the position of wiper and it will return to the original position after cleaning windsheet of motor vehicles  .
