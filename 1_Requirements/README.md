# INTRODUCTION
A windshield wiper, also known as a wiper blade, is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, and water from a vehicle's front glass.
Such wipers are mounted on all large motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, railroad locomotives, and certain aeroplanes.
After reading various research articles, I realised that safety requirements under adverse weather conditions are important even at low speeds for motor vehicles, therefore I began developing a wiper control system using arm-based microcontrollers.
It is made up of rubber blades attached to metal arms and pivot magnets at the other ends.
Finally, this project application assists users in their daily lives by preventing accidents and allowing for safe and healthy travel.
## RESEARCH
This application was analyzed from different sources (such as YouTube, Google, and research papers), and then adapted into a successful functioning model application of a wiper control system employing arm-based microcontrollers. 

## END GOAL
- Clear viewing in inclement weather.Â 
- Avoid accidents and promote safety with the most recent mechanism.

### Who
-  Everyone who wishes to drive safely and with a clear picture of the road.
### What
-   Wiper Control System for Automotives.
### Why
-   Curious about carrier in embedded system . 
### When 
-   When you recognise the significance of safety management and begin to hold yourself accountable for your health when driving in adverse weather conditions.
### Where
-   This can be  used by the user in day to day life where they can track their safety and  generate better results in life during travelling via motor vehicles  .
### How
-   LED shows the position of wiper and it will return to the original position after cleaning windsheet of motor vehicles  .
