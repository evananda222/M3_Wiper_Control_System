# INTRODUCTION
A windshield wiper, also known as a wiper blade, is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, and water from a vehicle's front glass.
Such wipers are mounted on all large motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, railroad locomotives, and certain aeroplanes.
After reading various research articles, I realised that safety requirements under adverse weather conditions are important even at low speeds for motor vehicles, therefore I began developing a wiper control system using arm-based microcontrollers.
It is made up of rubber blades attached to metal arms and pivot magnets at the other ends.
Finally, this project application assists users in their daily lives by preventing accidents and allowing for safe and healthy travel.

## RESEARCH
This utility is researched from diverse resources (such as you tube , google and studies papers ) after which i've changed into a success working model utility of wiper control system the usage of arm based totally microcontrollers

## END GOAL
- Clear vision in negative climate conditions.
- Avoid accidents and ensure safety with latest mechanism.

### Who
- Anybody who desires protection and clean vision of road in driving the usage of motor automobiles.
### What
- Wiper control system for motor vehicles.
### Why
- Curious about provider in embedded system 
### When
- Whilist you recognize the importance of protection management and begin to be responsible for your health during using motor automobiles in adverse weather conditions.
### Where
- This could be used by the user in everyday existence wherein they can track their protection and generate better results in existence at some stage in travelling through motor automobiles .
### How
- LED suggests the placement of wiper and it will return to the authentic function after cleaning windsheet of motor motors
