# Abstract
 -A windshield wiper, also known as a wiper blade, is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice, washer fluid, and water from a vehicle's front glass.
- Such wipers are mounted on all large motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, railroad locomotives, and certain aeroplanes.
- After reading various research articles, I realised that safety requirements under adverse weather conditions are important even at low speeds for motor vehicles, therefore I began developing a wiper control system using arm-based microcontrollers.
- It is made up of rubber blades attached to metal arms and pivot magnets at the other ends.
- Finally, this project application assists users in their daily lives by preventing accidents and allowing for safe and healthy travel.
